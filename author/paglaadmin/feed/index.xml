										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American actor Bryan Cranston took to Instagram on Saturday, to clarify that he is not completely retiring from acting, despite his statement that he wants to take a break when he turns 70 in 2026.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Godzilla&#8217; actor shared a string of pictures with his wife, Robin Dearden. He captioned the post, “Hey everyone, I hope this little message finds you well. Some news came out that wasn&#8217;t entirely clear&#8230;even to me.”</p>
<p>“So I wanted to set the record straight. I am not retiring. What I am going to do is hit the pause button for a year after I reach my 70th birthday in 2026. Holy crap &#8211; 70!” he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not even sure what &#8216;pausing&#8217; means entirely, but at this moment, I think it means that by taking a year off it will provide several things; First, it will allow me to spend time with Robin (my beautiful wife of 34 years now) in a way that I haven&#8217;t been able to in the last 25 years&#8230;not as a wife of a celebrity, but as a loving married couple entering into &#8211; well, let&#8217;s be honest, our latter years, with new hopes and goals and experiences,&#8221; Bryan said.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Breaking Bad&#8217; actor added, &#8220;Secondly, it gives me a sort of &#8216;reset&#8217; in my career. I&#8217;ve had such an unbelievable ride for over two decades &#8211; playing characters on TV, in films, and on stage that I could only have dreamt about&#8230;until it actually happened. I could not be more grateful and thankful for such opportunities.”</p>
<p>“That said, I feel as though I&#8217;m beginning to run out of fresh ideas on how to play the characters that I&#8217;m being offered. So exploring a more expanded life experience will give me the chance to replenish my soul and prepare for whatever roles I may be afforded in a more authentic way,” he added.</p>
<p>“I will unplug from social media, step off the hamster wheel of business, and dive into the classic novels that I&#8217;ve always promised myself I would read but haven&#8217;t&#8230;But before that happens, I&#8217;ve got some unfinished business.”</p>
<p>“Several films are coming out soon that I&#8217;m very proud of, I am producing a few stories for TV that I really love, and I am circling my attention on returning to Broadway &#8211; but this time in a new light&#8230;more on that later.”</p>
<p>“For now, let me just express my deep gratitude to all of you who have been so incredibly kind and generous with your time in reading my posts and following my career. I never take my good fortune for granted. I am blessed, and man, do I know it. I wish all of you well&#8230;and I&#8217;ll see you down the road. Love, Bryan,” the actor further added.</p>
<p>Bryan told British GQ that he intends to take a six-month break from acting and business ventures in 2026. His intention was to spend more time with his wife, Robin Dearden, as per Deadline.</p>
<p>Bryan and Robin started dating in 1987 and married in 1989. Taylor Dearden is their daughter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manchester City ended a sensational season by beating Inter Milan 1-0 to win the UEFA Champions League for the first time and complete the treble on a Saturday evening of frayed nerves.</p>
<p>Spanish midfielder Rodri’s 68th-minute goal settled a cagey game which a far-from-fluent City dominated without ever looking comfortable against the three-times winners from Italy at the Ataturk Stadium.</p>
<p>Inter almost levelled at the death when a point-blank header by substitute Romelu Lukaku was saved by Ederson.</p>
<p>But City, who lost in the final two years ago against Chelsea, would not be denied.</p>
<p>“Emotional. A dream come true. All these guys around here waited I don’t know how many years. They deserve, we deserve,” Rodri said.</p>
<p>In being crowned champions of Europe, they matched the treble achieved by Manchester United in 1999 of lifting the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League crowns.</p>
<p>City manager Pep Guardiola has now won the Champions League three times and took his trophy count with City to 12.</p>
<p>It was far from a fluent City performance, however, against a tireless Inter side who looked capable of causing a shock.</p>
<p>City were stifled in the first half and their fans were reduced to near silence at times as the nerves became frayed.</p>
<p>With Kevin de Bruyne off injured, City struggled to create chances and were wobbly at the back but in the end the ever-reliable Rodri came to the rescue.</p>
<p>For once Inter could not close down the spaces and Bernardo Silva’s cutback was swept home by the Spaniard.</p>
<p>Even then, City were forced to go to the wire at the end of long season with Lautaro Martinez hitting the bar for Inter and Lukaku denied by s superb Ederson save at the death.</p>
<p>In finally guiding Manchester City to the European crown they so cherished after a few gut-wrenching near misses since Sheikh Mansour bought the club in 2008, Guardiola became the first manager to achieve two trebles in European football, having done the Spanish equivalent with Barcelona in 2009.</p>
<p>He has won 12 trophies with City since taking charge in 2016 and with the Champions League jinx broken, any sense of inferiority City may have suffered to the established European royalty of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Liverpool has gone.</p>
<p>City still must defend themselves against more than 100 alleged breaches of Premier League financial regulations dating back to 2009, but that is for another day.</p>
<p>On Saturday alongside the Bosphorous, that was the last thing City’s joyous fans cared about as they celebrated the club’s first European trophy since the now defunct European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1969–70.</p>
<p>Guardiola’s side fluffed their lines in Porto two years ago when losing to Chelsea in the Champions League final &#8211; a defeat partially blamed on Guardiola’s tactics.</p>
<p>This time he and his players delivered, although it was far from straightforward against the wily Italian side.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marriages in China dropped in 2022 to their lowest since records began, local news outlet Yicai reported on Sunday, continuing a steady decline over the past decade although the matrimonial total may have been affected by stringent Covid lockdowns.</p>
<p>Just 6.83 million couples completed their marriage registrations last year, data published on the website of the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed, down about 800,000 from the previous year.</p>
<p>The drop in couples tieing the knot, which follows pandemic restrictions keeping tens of millions locked in their homes or compounds for weeks last year, comes as authorities deal with a declining birth rate and a falling population.</p>
<p>In 2022 China&#8217;s population fell for the first time in six decades, a decline that is expected to mark the start of a long period of decline in its citizen numbers with profound implications for its economy and the world.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s birth rate fell last year to 6.77 births per 1,000 people, the lowest on record, from 7.52 in 2021.</p>
<p>Demographers warn China will get old before it gets rich, as its workforce shrinks and indebted local governments spend more on their elderly population.</p>
<p>To encourage marriage and boost the country&#8217;s flagging birth rate, China said last month it would launch pilot projects in more than 20 cities to create a &#8220;new-era&#8221; marriage and childbearing culture.</p>
<p>Some provinces are also giving young newlyweds an extension of paid marriage leave.</p>
