										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marriages in China dropped in 2022 to their lowest since records began, local news outlet Yicai reported on Sunday, continuing a steady decline over the past decade although the matrimonial total may have been affected by stringent Covid lockdowns.</p>
<p>Just 6.83 million couples completed their marriage registrations last year, data published on the website of the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed, down about 800,000 from the previous year.</p>
<p>The drop in couples tieing the knot, which follows pandemic restrictions keeping tens of millions locked in their homes or compounds for weeks last year, comes as authorities deal with a declining birth rate and a falling population.</p>
<p>In 2022 China&#8217;s population fell for the first time in six decades, a decline that is expected to mark the start of a long period of decline in its citizen numbers with profound implications for its economy and the world.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s birth rate fell last year to 6.77 births per 1,000 people, the lowest on record, from 7.52 in 2021.</p>
<p>Demographers warn China will get old before it gets rich, as its workforce shrinks and indebted local governments spend more on their elderly population.</p>
<p>To encourage marriage and boost the country&#8217;s flagging birth rate, China said last month it would launch pilot projects in more than 20 cities to create a &#8220;new-era&#8221; marriage and childbearing culture.</p>
<p>Some provinces are also giving young newlyweds an extension of paid marriage leave.</p>
